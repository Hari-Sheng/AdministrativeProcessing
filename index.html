        The typical thing is just not applied to Chinese and Indian citizens: Visa check (a.k.a. Administrative
        Processing) is a process lot os people have to go through.
        And according to the self reported data at <>, the
        <bf>typical</bf>
        > waiting time is around 2 months and could up to 500 days.

        We try to visualize the data to help people around the world understand the severity of this
        <bf>Administrative
            Processing
        </bf>
        . Unfortunately we are not able to visualize the waste of time, monty and efforts during waiting, desperation
        and
        anxiety when separating from family and friends.
